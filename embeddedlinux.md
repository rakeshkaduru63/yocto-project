# Embedded Linux Architecture Overview

## üì¶ System Images (Loaded into Embedded System)
These are essential components required to boot and run Linux on a target board (e.g., Raspberry Pi):

### ‚óº Bootloader Image (e.g., U-Boot)
- First component to run after power-on/reset.
- Initializes hardware (CPU, RAM).
- Loads the kernel image and device tree into memory.
  

### ‚óº Devicetree
- Describes the hardware layout to the kernel (CPU, memory, peripherals).
- Example: tells the kernel what devices exist and how to access them.

### ‚óº Linux Kernel Image
- Core of the OS that manages hardware, processes, memory, etc.
- Communicates with hardware through drivers.
- Provides system calls for applications.

### ‚óº File System Image (rootfs + partitions)
- Contains user-space software: C library, BusyBox, applications, config files.
- This is the root filesystem mounted by the kernel after boot.

## üß† Logical Architecture Breakdown
Explains how system components are layered in memory and execution:

### üî¥ Bootloader
- Initializes system and jumps to the kernel.

### üî∑ Kernel Space
- **System Call Interface**: Gateway for user-space programs to access kernel features (e.g., open, read, write).
- **Core Kernel Components**:
  - **Network Stack**: Manages TCP/IP, routing, Wi-Fi/Ethernet.
  - **Virtual Filesystem**: Supports filesystems like ext4, FAT via common API.
  - **Process Management**: Handles creation, scheduling, termination.
  - **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Manages memory, virtual-to-physical address mapping.
  - **IPC**: Mechanisms like pipes, message queues, shared memory.
  - **Architecture Dependent Code**: Code for specific CPU architectures (ARM, x86).
  - **Device Drivers**: Interface between kernel and hardware (USB, Wi-Fi, etc.).

### üü° User Space
Where your applications and tools run:

- **C Library (libc)**: Provides standard functions (e.g., printf, malloc, open). Bridges apps to system calls.
- **Other Libraries**: GUI, networking, and more.
- **BusyBox**: Collection of Unix utilities in a single small executable.
- **Services & Desktop Manager**: Background services (networking, logging), GUI components.
- **Applications**: Custom or user-installed software.

# üêß How Linux Boots ‚Äì Simplified Explanation
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-01 160500" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a670323d-372d-4770-bfda-35cc0a32a4a1" />

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è 1. Power Up

- Electrical power is supplied to the system.
- CPU and other components (RAM, storage, peripherals) receive voltage.
- The CPU starts executing code from **Boot ROM** (typically stored in SoC).
- This code usually initializes the **Bootloader**.

---

## üß∞ 2. Bootloader Stage

Bootloader is typically divided into two parts:

### üîπ Primary Bootloader (Stage 1)

- Resides in ROM or the first sector of storage.
- Initializes core components:
  - CPU
  - Minimal RAM setup
  - Basic clock, etc.

### üî∏ Secondary Bootloader (Stage 2)

- Loaded by the primary bootloader into RAM.
- More capable ‚Äî initializes:
  - Full RAM
  - Storage devices (eMMC, SD card, NAND/NOR Flash)
  - Optional peripherals (PCIe, Ethernet, GPU)
- Loads the **Linux kernel** into RAM
- Loads **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** ‚Äî describes hardware layout
- Optionally loads:
  - **GPU firmware**
  - **initrd/initramfs** (RAM disk)
- Finally, jumps to the **kernel's entry point**

---

## üß† 3. Linux Kernel Stage

- Starts running in protected mode (ARM or x86 depending on architecture).
- Key tasks:
  - Mount `initrd` (optional temporary root filesystem)
  - Initialize kernel subsystems:
    - Memory management
    - Scheduler
    - VFS (Virtual File System)
    - IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
  - Load drivers using information from **Device Tree**
  - Starts the `init` process (PID 1)

---

## üß± 4. Linux Userspace

- `init` system (e.g., **systemd**, **SysVinit**, or **upstart**) takes over.
- Reads system configuration files (`/etc/`)
- Launches:
  - Services (network, display manager, logging)
  - Shell or desktop environment
  - User applications

---

## üü¢ 5. Application Ready

- After services are initialized, applications can run.
- System is fully operational.
- Total boot time varies depending on:
  - Optimizations
  - Bootloader/kernel size
  - Hardware speed

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Example Boot Time Flow

| Stage           | Time    | Notes                          |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Power Up         | ~1s     | Depends on hardware startup    |
| Bootloader       | ~2-3s   | Includes kernel + DTB loading  |
| Kernel Init      | ~1-2s   | Mount, driver init, etc.       |
| Userspace Init   | ~5-10s  | Depends on init system         |
| **Total**        | ~8-15s  | Can be reduced with tuning     |

---

## üîß Notes for Optimization

- Disable unused kernel drivers.
- Use minimal `initramfs`.
- Parallelize service startup (e.g., with `systemd`).
- Use fast storage (eMMC over SD).
- Optimize bootloader configuration (e.g., U-Boot script).

## üß† How Raspberry Pi Boots from SD Card
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-01 161353" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/effc9c71-7948-46b2-89d1-81761a2fa3dc" />

### üîπ 1. First Stage ‚Äì EEPROM (ROM Bootloader)
Raspberry Pi has a small ROM in EEPROM.

This stage initializes hardware and loads the second-stage bootloader from the SD card (`bootcode.bin`).

### üîπ 2. Second Stage ‚Äì `bootcode.bin`
Found in the boot partition (FAT32).

Loads a GPU firmware binary called `start.elf`.

### üîπ 3. Third Stage ‚Äì `start*.elf`
Initializes the GPU firmware.

Reads `config.txt` (user-defined settings).

Then optionally launches **U-Boot** (if configured).

### üîπ (Optional) U-Boot
A flexible bootloader used in embedded systems.

Loads:
- `boot.scr` (boot script file)
- `kernel8.img` (ARM64 kernel image)

### üîπ 4. Kernel Boot
After U-Boot (or directly from `start.elf`), the kernel image is loaded.

Kernel then mounts the root filesystem (`rootfs`).

### üîπ Final: Dom0 (Linux OS User Space)
Kernel passes control to user space.

Loads `init` process ‚Üí full OS boots.
