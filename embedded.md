## SECURITY SYSTEM->ring my phone when somebody is at my door



# Intruder Detection System: Design Options

## ✅ 1. Option One: Generic Purpose Computer

**Approach**:  
Use a generic computer, attach a camera, and develop an OpenCV application to detect intruders and send Wi-Fi commands.

### ✅ Pros:
- Development time is significantly lower due to fewer limitations compared to embedded systems.

### ❌ Cons:
- Cannot be presented as a product to a customer.
- Has many unused features beyond intruder detection.
- Prone to security risks.
- Takes up a large space.
- Boots very slow due to running a full operating system.
- Significantly expensive.

### 📌 Conclusion:
> This approach is **not feasible** for a product.

### ✅ Pros:
- Significantly reduced cost.
- Option to embed camera modules directly into the PCB.
- Achieves maximum price optimization when producing **millions of units**.
- Results in a product with **only specific features** (removal of generic hardware/software).

### ❌ Cons:
- Increased overall development **cost and time** because creating a new product is complex.
- Software development can take longer due to limitations with ARM processors commonly used in embedded systems.

# 🔧 Embedded System from Hardware Perspective

## 🧱 1. Starts from Sand
The journey begins with **sand**, which contains **silicon**.  
Silicon is **purified and processed** to create **transistors** — the building blocks of all digital electronics.

---


<!--
The term "transistor" is a portmanteau of "transfer" and "resistor".
A transistor is a semiconductor device that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
-->

## ⚙️ 2. Transistor Made of Silicon
A **transistor** is a tiny electronic switch.  
**Billions** of these are combined to make **integrated circuits (ICs)** or **chips**.  
Transistors are essential for **processing and storing data**.

---

## 🧠 3. Layout Design
Engineers create a **layout design** of the chip using **software tools**.  
This design decides how **millions/billions of transistors** are connected and how **data flows**.

---

## 💾 4. Chip Creation
The layout is used to **manufacture the chip** (e.g., **Rockchip RK3399**).  
This chip acts as the **brain of the embedded system** and includes:
- CPU
- GPU
- Memory controller
- Other processing units

---

## 🔌 5. PCB Design (Printed Circuit Board)
The chip is placed onto a **PCB**, which connects all components together.  
PCB design includes:
- Tracks (wires)
- Power lines
- Connectors (e.g., USB, HDMI)

It ensures **communication** between chip, memory, sensors, and other parts.

---

## 🖥️ 6. Board Assembly
The final **embedded board** contains:
- The chip  
- **Memory** (RAM/Flash)  
- **Power circuits**  
- **Connectors** (USB, HDMI, etc.)

This board goes into an **embedded product** such as:
- Smartphone
- Washing machine
- Drone
- Smart camera

# 🧠 Embedded System from Software Perspective (Detailed)

In an embedded system, **hardware and software work together** to perform a **specific function**.  
While the hardware is built using chips like **CPU, RAM, and Storage**, the software **controls how these chips function**.

---

## 🔌 Essential Chips on a Board

Every embedded board includes **multiple chips**, and the most important ones are:

### 🧠 CPU / ASIC / FPGA
- Acts as the **brain of the system**
- Runs the **operating system**, executes code, and handles tasks
- Could be **general-purpose (CPU)** or **application-specific (ASIC)**

### 💾 Storage (Flash Memory)
- Stores the **system image**, **firmware**, **bootloader**, and **application data**
- **Non-volatile** – data stays even when power is off

### 🧮 RAM (Temporary Memory)
- Used for **fast access and execution**
- **Temporary** – cleared when the system is powered off
- Loads apps and the operating system during runtime

### 🔌 Other Chips (Optional but Important)
- **Ethernet / USB Controllers** – for communication and data transfer
- **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS** – for wireless functionality
- **Power Management ICs (PMICs)** – manage power supply to all chips

---

## ⚙️ Software Flashing Process

To make the system work, you need to **flash software images (firmware)** to each chip:

- **Flashing CPU** – Loads the **bootloader** and **operating system**
- **Flashing Storage** – Stores **system files**, **drivers**, and **updates**
- **Flashing RAM** – Loads **running applications** and **active processes**

✅ This ensures each chip is **configured correctly**, and the **entire system operates reliably**.

---

## 🧱 Software Architecture (Layer by Layer)

| Software Layer | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Kernel**     | Core component of the OS. Manages **CPU**, **memory**, **process scheduling**, and **I/O**. |
| **Drivers**    | Allow the **kernel** to talk to **hardware** (e.g., display, audio, storage). |
| **C Library**  | Provides **system-level functions** (like `open()`, `read()`, `malloc()`, etc.). |
| **Libraries**  | Help applications and services reuse code. Examples: **networking**, **graphics**. |
| **Services**   | Background **daemons** (e.g., `systemd`, Android’s `system_server`) handle system tasks. |
| **Applications** | Front-end programs (UI or logic) that perform tasks like **camera**, **settings**, or **games**. |

---

## ✅ Final Points

- Without software, the hardware is **inactive**
- Flashing the **correct image to each chip** is **critical** for functionality
- A working embedded system must be able to:
  - ✅ **Boot properly**
  - ✅ **Run applications**
  - ✅ **Manage hardware efficiently**
  - ✅ **Utilize resources** (CPU, memory) correctly

# 🖥️ Desktop Linux

## 1. Linux Kernel (The Core of the Operating System)
The Linux Kernel is the central component of the Linux operating system.  
It acts as a bridge between the hardware and user applications, managing system resources and ensuring secure, efficient operations.

### 🔧 Responsibilities:
- **Process management**
- **Memory management (MMU)**
- **Device management**
- **Inter-process communication (IPC)**
- **Debugging support**

---

## 2. Drivers (Interface Between Hardware and Kernel)
Device drivers are software modules that allow the kernel and user space to communicate with hardware.

### 🧩 Types of Drivers:
- **USB devices**
- **Buses**
- **PCIe devices**
- **Chip drivers**

---

## 🔧 Middleware Layer

### 3. System Call Interface
Acts as a bridge between **user space** and **kernel space**.  
Libraries and services use this to request kernel-level operations.

### 4. Libraries
Provide reusable functions for applications and services:
- `libboost` (C++ support)
- `C lib` (standard C functions)
- GUI-related libraries like **Qt5**

### 5. Services
Background daemons and system-level services:
- `systemd` (system and service manager)
- **Network and Bluetooth services**

---

## 🖥️ User Space / Application Layer

### 6. Applications
GUI or command-line apps (e.g., browsers, editors)  
Rely on services and libraries.
## 7. Compositor

A **compositor** is part of the windowing system that draws windows and manages visual effects like transparency, shadows, and animations.

### Examples:
- **X11 (X.Org Server)** – Traditional window system, requires a separate compositor (e.g., *compton*, *xcompmgr*).
- **Wayland** – Modern alternative to X11 with built-in compositing (e.g., *Weston*, *Mutter*, *KWin*).

**Role:** Manages how windows are drawn and interact visually on the screen (overlap, transitions, etc.).

---

## 8. Desktop Environment (Desktop Manager)

A **Desktop Environment (DE)** provides the complete graphical user interface (GUI) shell for user interaction with the system. It includes components like the desktop shell, panels, file manager, settings, and themes.

### Popular Desktop Environments:

### GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment)
- Default on many Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora, Ubuntu).
- Uses **Mutter** as its window manager and compositor.
- Focuses on a clean, simple, modern design.

### KDE (K Desktop Environment)
- Now known as **KDE Plasma**.
- Uses **KWin** as the window manager and compositor.
- Highly customizable with a more traditional desktop layout.
